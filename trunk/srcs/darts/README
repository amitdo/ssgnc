A clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System)

This project provides a clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System).
This clone library has an advantage in memory.

The Darts is a C++ header library for the double-array implemented by
Taku Kudo. The double-array was presented by Jun-ichi Aoe as an
efficient implementation of a trie. In practice, the Darts is used in
several applications such as ChaSen and MeCab (Japanese morphological
analyzers) because the double-array provides fast prefix matching for
multiple patterns with a compact dictionary.

However, the Darts is based on a traditional implementation, and in fact,
we can improve the performance of the Darts by using a new implementation.
Therefore, this project provides a Darts-like library that is based on
a new implementation of the double-array.
